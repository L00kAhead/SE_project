# SE Project
In this project, I cloned a popular e-commerce website 'Amazon'. It is built using React.js. The project covers most of the functionality of e-commerce, such as adding and removing products to the cart, the ability to login and register, user authentication with Firebase, and payment with the Stripe API.

### Technology Stack
* React.js -  project's main development library of JS 
* Node.js -  It is used to install software packages easily, without having to worry about dependencies using npm.
* Firebase -  It is used for Authentication, Database, Functions and Hosting
* Stripe - It is used to process payment (Stripe API)
