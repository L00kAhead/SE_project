# SE Project
In this project, I cloned a popular e-commerce website 'Amazon'. It is built using React.js. The project covers most of the functionality of e-commerce, such as adding and removing products to the cart, the ability to login and register, user authentication with Firebase, and payment with the Stripe API.
